CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Warning (dev) at /home/tally/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/clion-nova/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL2_IMAGE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (SDL2_image).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_modules/FindSDL2_image.cmake:159 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
